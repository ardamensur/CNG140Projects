Description: Drop Dead is a dice game, created by United States soldiers as an alternative to poker. You will write a program for playing a Drop Dead game between a player and computer.

Drop Dead Game Rules:
Equipment: 5 dice and a scoresheet
Number of Players: 2 players

How to play:
At the beginning to decide who is going to start the game, each player rolls one die. The player who rolls the highest die starts the game. The game consists of N rounds â€“ each player will play N turns. The game is played with 5 dice. The first player rolls all five dice to start his/her turn. A player rolls the five dice and if the throw does not include a 2 or 5, they receive the score of the total numbers added together. That player is also able to roll the dice again. When a player rolls the dice and any of them containing a 2 or 5, they score no points and the dice that includes a 2 or 5 is excluded from any future throws that they make. A player's turn does not stop until their last remaining die shows only a 2 and/or 5. At that point, the player "drops dead" and it becomes the next player's turn. The highest total score wins.
